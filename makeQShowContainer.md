# Making the qShow container component
There should be a component which takes the following as arguments
- [ ] score
- [ ] progress bar, to show how far through the set of questions (only visible if more than one question is in the current set)
- [ ] question object, with fields: qType, question, answer (this will be extended later)
- [ ] status, eg: lives lost

## first commit
- [ ] just display a description of what should be in that part of the screen. eg: 'score'
